# Welcome to Relational Learning

Relational learning is machine learning for relational data. Relational data provide information about entities and the relationships among them. This site collects resources to support research and teaching about relational learning. It includes pointers to datasets, implemented systems, tutorials and readings. 


## Relational Datasets

This section provides links to relational datasets and data formats.
Relational data have been studied in several communities, using different terminology and different data formats. Common terms for a relational dataset include the following. 

+ <i> Relational Database. </i> The most common relational format in industry based on the SQL standard.
+ <i> Network. </i> For network analysis, relational data can be visualized as a heterogeneous network with different types of nodes and (hyper)edges. 
+ <i> Matrix/Tensor </i>. In statistics and machine learning, data based on a relationship among two entities are represented using a matrix. Relationships involving more than two entities can be represented using a tensor. 
+ <i> Finite model, ground literals, facts. </i> The common representation in computational logic, including logic programming.
+ <i> A-box, triples, knowledge graph. </i> In description logic, semantic web ontologies, and the Resource Description Framework (RDF), relational data are also represented as collections of facts in a formal language. A knowledge graph visualizes the facts in a network. 

Relational learning algorithms can be applied to any of these data representations, although specific implementations may require the input data to be in a specific format.

## Relational Learning Tasks

The site is organized around important learning tasks, and emphasizes approaches for which implementations are available. Tasks covered include, ....

## Relational Inference Tasks

inference is important: goal of system, used as subroutine. Also relationship to AI, satisfiability solving, formal verification.

## Readings

This section provides links to readings with a broad scope, including survey articles, books, and tutorials. 

### Info for Editors

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/relational-learning/relational-learning.github.io/wiki/Github-Pages-Info) for a short customized collection of tips. The sidebar is an exhaustive list of authoring resources for the theme.
