# Welcome to Relational Learning

Relational learning is machine learning for relational data. Relational data provide information about entities and the relationships among them. This site collects resources to support research and teaching about relational learning. It includes pointers to datasets, implemented systems, tutorials and readings. 


## Relational Datasets

We provide links to relational datasets and data formats.
Relational data have been studied in several communities, using different terminology and different data formats. Other common terms for a relational dataset include the following. 

(relational database, network, information, heterogenous, matrix, tensor, ground literals, model, facts (Prolog), triples, A-box. 

## Relational Learning Tasks

The site is organized around important learning tasks, and emphasizes approaches for which implementations are available. Tasks covered include, ....

## Relational Inference Tasks

inference is important: goal of system, used as subroutine. Also relationship to AI.

## Readings

This section provides links to readings with a broad scope, including survey articles, books, and tutorials.
